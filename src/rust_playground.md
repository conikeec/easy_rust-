# Rust Playground

Maybe you don't want to install Rust yet, and that's okay. You can go to https://play.rust-lang.org/ and start writing Rust. You can write your code there and click Run to see the results.

Here are some tips when using the Rust Playground:

* Run your code with Run
* Change Debug to Release if you want your code to be faster. Debug: compiles faster, runs slower, contains debug information. Release: compiles slower, runs much faster, removes debug information.
* Click on Share to get a url. You can use that to share your code if you want help.
* Tools: Rustfmt will format your code nicely.
* Tools: Clippy will give you extra information about how to make your code better.
* Config: here you can change your theme to dark mode, and many other configurations.

If you want to install Rust, go here https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install and follow the instructions. Usually you will use ```rustup``` to install and update Rust.
